CMT is a Cluster Management Tool originally created at SARA Computing and
Networking Services, which is based in Amsterdam and known as SURFsara nowadays.

The main reason behind CMT's existence is that we needed a tool that's capable
of generating configuration-files for certain software running on our clusters.
CMT has a database, where we store information about our hardware, which is
used to (let CMT) generate configuration-files, based on templates. At SURFsara
it's used in production, to generate configuration-files for services like for
example dhcpd and bind.
