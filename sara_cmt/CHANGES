v1.0, 16 May 2012 -- Initial packaged release.

* From now on the config is distributed as a sample config file, which differs
  from previous config files.
  Users have to modify the sample config file to reflect their settings and
  rename it to activate the settings.   
* All extra templatetags are in a single file now, and some of them have been
  changed a little.
  Users have to check their current templates to be sure they are still working
  as expected.
* CMT is now distributed as a package, installable with pip.
