v2.5.0
======
In this release we focussed to make the API more usable, also making CMT comptable with
the the newer releases of the different requirements.

Added:
 * New API version v2, due to compatibility issues between djangorestframework
   versions we cannot support API v1 anymore (from version 2.4.8 to 3.6.3)
 * Complete rewrite of the CMT client, no extra modules required and can be downloaded
   via the CMT server web ui. Client does not need configuration, the client contains
   the correct settings when you download it (dynamic)
 * Simplified configuration handling


Bugfixes:
 * Fixed domain validator could not accept vu.nl and may others
   Reported by: Juan Luis Font, SURFsara
 * Restructured the project to the Django "standard"
 * Support for Django 1.8 LTS / 1.9
 * Support for Djangorestframework 3.6
 * Renamed model HardwareUnit to Equipment, so it's the same as with the API
 * Updated codebase on several levels to support newer versions of the different requirements of CMT
 * Better support for VirtualEnv
 * Use the Django logging framework instead of writing your own one

  changed a little.
  Users have to check their current templates to be sure they are still working
  as expected.
* CMT is now distributed as a package, installable with pip.
